## SIMPLE SHELL - ALX PROJECT
### Project objectives
- Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
- Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
- Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language
- How does a shell work
- What is a pid and a ppid
- How to manipulate the environment of the current process
- What is the difference between a function and a system call
- How to create processes
- What are the three prototypes of main
- How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
- How to execute another program with the execve system call
- How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
- What is EOF / ‚Äúend-of-file‚Äù?

### Compilation

````
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
````
### Testing
##### In interactive mode
````
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$
````
##### In non interactive mode
````
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2

### Objectif üëç
task 0
betty checks executed
task 1
-Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
-The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
-The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
-The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
-If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.Handle errors.
-You have to handle the ‚Äúend of file‚Äù condition (Ctrl+D)

task 2
-Handle command lines with arguments

task 3
-Handle the PATH
-fork must not be called if the command doesn‚Äôt exist

task 4
-Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell
-Usage: exit
-You don‚Äôt have to handle any argument to the built-in exit

task 5
-Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment

task 6 advanced
-Write your own getline function
-Use a buffer to read many chars at once and call the least possible the read system call
-You will need to use static variables
-You are not allowed to use getline

task 7 advanced
-You are not allowed to use strtok

task 8 advanced
-handle arguments for the built-in exit
-Usage: exit status, where status is an integer used to exit the shell

task 9 advanced
-Implement the setenv and unsetenv builtin commands 
setenv
-Initialize a new environment variable, or modify an existing one
-Command syntax: setenv VARIABLE VALUE
-Should print something on stderr on failure
unsetenv
-Remove an environment variable
-Command syntax: unsetenv VARIABLE
-Should print something on stderr on failure

task 10 advanced
-Implement the builtin command cd:
-Changes the current directory of the process.
-Command syntax: cd [DIRECTORY]
-If no argument is given to cd the command must be interpreted like cd $HOME
-You have to handle the command cd -
-You have to update the environment variable PWD when you change directory
man chdir, man getcwd

task 11 advanced
-Handle the commands separator ;

task 12 advanced
-Handle the && and || shell logical operators

task 13 advanced
-Implement the alias builtin command
-Usage: alias [name[='value'] ...]
-alias: Prints a list of all aliases, one per line, in the form name='value'
-alias name [name2 ...]: Prints the aliases name, name2, etc 1 per line, in the form name='value'
-alias name='value' [...]: Defines an alias for each name whose value is given. If name is already an alias, replaces its value with value

task 14 advanced
-Handle variables replacement
-Handle the $? variable
-Handle the $$ variable

task 15 advanced
-Handle comments (#)

task 16 advanced
-Usage: simple_shell [filename]
-Your shell can take a file as a command line argument
-The file contains all the commands that your shell should run before exiting
-The file should contain one command per line
-In this mode, the shell should not print a prompt and should not read from stdin
